```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data validation

The goal here is to include/exclude data based on inclusion criteria and deliver a data-structure (data.frame most likely) that can be used for the main analyses.  

Input: participant level data files (ie trials) & lab level data files (participant information) which have been validated in the previous step

Output: data structures as input for the main analyses. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
