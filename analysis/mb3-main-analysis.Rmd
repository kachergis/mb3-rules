```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data validation

The goal here is to run the models necessary for testing the hypotheses. 

Input: data.frames that result from pre-processing, format needs to be defined

Output:  data summaries & tables, data visualisations, table with results from hypothesis tests

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
