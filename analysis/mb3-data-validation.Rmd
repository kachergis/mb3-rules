```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data validation

The goal here is to check that data is valid, eg by plotting, by computing summary statistics, by checking the range of values for certain variables et cetera. 

Input: participant level data files (ie trials) & lab level data files (participant information)

Output: list of valid/invalid data identifiers (lab id + participant id)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
